## Application description
This application is part of the Shamsin Company project, where the company produces food materials and is sold in schools in the Emirates, as our application is responsible for selling to students, as the sale is done via a card given to the student with his own QR code on it. He can buy food through it, and the point of sale can request Invoices from the factory to the school. Invoices can also be requested from nearby schools, as well as an inventory of what has been sold or remaining materials
